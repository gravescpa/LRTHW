# Exercise 7

# This prints the text string
puts "Mary had a little lamb."

# This prints the text string, along with the string snow
puts "Its fleece was white as #{'snow'}."

# This prints the text string
puts "And everywhere that Mary went."

# This print the value of the string times 10.  
puts "." * 10 # What'd that do? It prints ten periods

# This defines the variable with a value of C
end1 = "C"

# This defines the variable with a value of h
end2 = "h"

# This defines the variable with a value of e
end3 = "e"

# This defines the variable with a value of e
end4 = "e"

# This defines the variable with a value of s
end5 = "s"

# This defines the variable with a value of e
end6 = "e"

# This defines the variable with a value of B
end7 = "B"

# This defines the variable with a value of u
end8 = "u"

# This defines the variable with a value of r
end9 = "r"

# This defines the variable with a value of g
end10 = "g"

# This defines the variable with a value of e
end11 = "e"

# This defines the variable with a value of r
end12 = "r"


# watch that print vs. puts on this line what's it do?
# it looks like the print function does not include a return at the end
print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6

# This prints the concatenation of the variables listed
puts end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12
